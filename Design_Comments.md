# Design Comments on the Ordinary Section

- The Weather Deck is thicker than calculated to get a boost in Z,deck (also we done no calculations for the hatch coamings)
- The Weather Deck stiffeners are essentially ` impostor ` bulbous stiffeners
- The Inner Bottom and Bottom Shell plates are roughly the same size for construction homogeneity 
- The wing tank makes sense to have multiple plates like in the mother ship though design is kept simple for the time being.
- The plates where given dimensions based on the mother ship without following them to heart
- The plates may be thicker than the calculations imply but this is done to ensure we have adequate area moments

# Add to report

- $k$ material coefficient is calculated as a weighted average of the plating's materials $k$ => $k ={ \sum^N_n k_n \over N}$, where N the total
  number of stiffened plates [x]
