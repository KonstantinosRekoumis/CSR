# To Do 
## Major Importance
1) Do the project
1) Fix the input file for the Tmin, Lsc and Tsc  

## Medium Importance
1) Not lose sanity
1) physics module HSM ans BSP need Lwl not LBP on weather deck calculations

## Minor Importance - Future Extending
1) Augment the physics external_loadC method to account for more cases (only fully supports HSM and BSP)
